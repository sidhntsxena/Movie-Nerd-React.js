# Movie Nerd - React.js

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- `@vitejs/plugin-react` uses Babel for Fast Refresh
- `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` uses SWC for Fast Refresh

Expanding the ESLint configuration:
If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enabling type-aware lint rules. Check out the TS template to integrate TypeScript and `typescript-eslint` in your project.
